These are the Config.h and Config_adv.h files for the Ender 5 3D printer under Marlin 2.0.6.  
This is compiled and running on the BTT SKR Mini E3 v1.2 with 3D Touch Probe (BL Touch Clone)  
  
This firmware should capture most of the Ender 5 settings.

As always some modifications will need to be made to account for your own touch probe offsets, linear advance, junction deviation, etc...
